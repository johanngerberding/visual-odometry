# Visual Odometry
 
Starting with simple Monocular Visual Odometry in Python.

## TODOs 

* compare different Feature Detectors and Matching Algorithms (quality and speed)
* implement Stereo Vision Odometry 
* implement everything in C++
* make visualizations prettier 
* I think SIFT doesn't work correctly
